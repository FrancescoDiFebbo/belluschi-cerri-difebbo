The main stakeholder of the project is the government of a large city.
The government, with the help of the transport council, decided to improve the actual taxi service with MyTaxiService.
With MyTaxiService the stakeholders want to:

\begin{itemize}
	\item symplify the access of passangers to the service
	\item guarantee a fair management of taxi queues
	\item give the possibility to the passengers to reserve a taxi 
	\item give the possibility to a passenger to share a taxi with other passengers
	
\end{itemize}
