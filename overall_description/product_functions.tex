The system allows different kinds of user to perform different actions. In particular:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Visitors can simply register or log in, thus becoming either a passenger or a taxi driver user.
  \item Passengers can request, reserve and share taxi rides.
  \item Taxi drivers can modify their availability status and respond (accept/refuse) to impeding ride requests.
\end{itemize}
