Registered users can be either passengers or taxi drivers.\newline
The system wants to give both an easy way to interact, thus optimizing the taxi service. To do so, passengers must be able to install and use the mobile application, or use the web application. On the contrary, taxi drivers can only install and use the mobile app; besides, their cellphone must be provided with a GPS. All users must have access to the Internet.
