\subsection{Purpose}
	This is the \textit{Project Plan} (\textbf{PP}) for \textit{myTaxiService}.
	Its purpose is to evaluate time and resources necessary to develop the entire \textit{myTaxiService} system, including mobile and web applications.\\
	To do so, the \textbf{Function Points} measurement and the \textbf{COCOMO} model have been used, comparing the results with the system size and the implementation time.

	is a taxi service for a large city. The main goals of the system
	are:
	\begin{itemize}
