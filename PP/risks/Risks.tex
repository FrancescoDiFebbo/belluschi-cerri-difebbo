The project is subject to a series of risks with different levels of danger.\\
Main problems such as developers' lack of experience in programming and in project planning and management could potentially slow down the overall project development, thus leading to the risk of an extension of some deadlines, or at least to some incomplete, minor tasks at the time of delivery.
In particular, the team could get into various technical issues, mainly deployment difficulties of myTaxiService in pre-existing, large-city, taxi-management systems (deliberately not considered in the development of myTaxiService). Besides, scalability issues and subsequent server downtime and data loss could pose some major threats.
Finally, noteworthy legal and economical problems such as bankruptcy, market competition and major changes in taxi management policy ought to be taken into account: to avoid them, a good feasibility study is recommended.
