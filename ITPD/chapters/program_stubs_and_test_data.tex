This section describes the specification of stubs and drivers needed to replace the part of software components that still don't exist and test the others. This is necessary to perform the integration steps.
DBMS should contain sample data in order to perform proper test cases. 
In early development, web and mobile applications are replaced by stubs to test the client connection. These stubs should provide sample data to correctly simulate real-life conditions. 
During development some components may not be available yet for integration test, thus they will be replaced by drivers.
