This section describes the tools required to perform the integration testing plan described previously.
Following the validation and verification model, it is possible to perform different tests on components.

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{jUnit}: is a unit testing framework for the Java programming language. Each individual units of source code, sets of one or more computer program modules together with associated control data, usage procedures, and operating procedures, are tested to determine whether they are fit for use.
	\item \textbf{Mockito}: is an open source testing framework for Java that allows the creation of test double objects (mock objects) in automated unit tests. It allows to abstract dependencies and have predictable results; to check that the interaction between the testee and the mock is correct. 
	\item \textbf{Arquillian}: a test framework that can be used to perform testing inside a remote or embedded container, or deploy an archive to a container so the test can interact as a remote client.
	\item \textbf{Apache JMeter}: is designed to load test functional behaviour and measure performance of a variety of services, with a focus on web applications
