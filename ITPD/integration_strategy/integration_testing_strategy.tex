The integration testing strategy, conducted in this project, is a \textit{bottom-up} approach. This strategy tests the lower level components and start testing a way upwards to higher level components. The advantage of this strategy is that it's easier to maintain code, smaller modules have unit tests and there is a clearer structure of how to do things. The disadvantage is that when releasing a prototype it's impossible to see a working prototype until nearly all the program has been completed so that may take a long time before this happens. There may be a lot of errors later on regarding the GUI and programming later on.
